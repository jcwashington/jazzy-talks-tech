  # Jazzy Talks Tech!!

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

  ## Description
  The goal here was to build blog site -- similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their own tech blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. An all around fun place to talk tech.
  It's worth noting that this app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure and Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the [express-session npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) for authentication. An intended user story could be as follows:

    ```md
    AS A developer who writes about tech
    I WANT a CMS-style blog site
    SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions
    ```
